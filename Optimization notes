CONTIGUOUS SYSTEM BECOMES SLIGHTLY BUT ALMOST ALWAYS FASTER THAN NON-CONTIGUOUS!


After slight optimization to areColliding (initialized min/max with first vertex rather than to
positive/negative infinity, thus saving 1 iteration).
Noncontiguous polygon collision check for 10000 polygons took 1.17721 seconds.
Contiguous polygon collision check for 10000 polygons took 1.16741 seconds.
